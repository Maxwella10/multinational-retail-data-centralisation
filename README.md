# multinational-retail-data-centralisation

Collate and analyse data from various sources, to create a local, centralised PostgreSQL sales database which acts as a single source of truth for sales data. Query the data to extract business metrics.

This is a project from AiCore based on the scenario that I am working for a multinational company that sells various goods across the globe and thus the sales data is spread in various data sources. The main aim of this project is to get sales data accessible to one centralised location or database so that the data is easily accessible or analysable by current members of the team. And hence query the database to get up-to-date metrics for the business.

In this project we are using pgAdmin4 to store the data in the database postgres and postgreSQL for querying. This database will store all the company information once you extract it for the various data sources.
